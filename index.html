                <p>As Managing Director, I experienced a challenge with one of our due diligence services. At the time, several large corporations relied on us to help them vet acquisition opportunities. Due to overlap in interests and confidentiality obligations, we often had to conflict out of projects, leading to a loss in potential revenue. Through strategic thinking and planning, I was able to turn this loss into a significant advantage.

                <p>From start to finish, I created and implemented a plan to launch our first SaaS product from which all of our clients would be able to access our analysis via a subscription. First, I surveyed clients for a sense of their needs and for pricing feedback. No such service already existed, but I directed my team in completing industry research to understand the closest alternatives and their strengths and weaknesses. I worked with our finance team to create a budget for the development and staffing of the project and to create revenue projections.

                <p>With a plan in place, I began designing the product, personally creating the wireframes for the web application. I hired a software development team and worked closely with them to complete the development. I led the team in testing the application and bug reporting until it was ready for beta testing from paying subscribers.

                <p>Next, I created the sales strategy and managed the creation of marketing materials. I trained the sales team members on how to sell the service.

                <p>The service launch was a success. Our clients were now able to access our due diligence on any acquisition opportunity, which also resulted in an increase in our deeper-dive due diligence analysis engagements; one of our most profitable services. In addition, we became known as one of the best sources for a complete view of the market, giving us access to more clients and growing our reputation in the market.

                <p>Early in my career, I was on a sales trip to Japan with our CEO. Before leaving, I researched potential new clients and prepared materials we could use to cross-sell into existing clients. My primary focus was to acquire new clients for our brokerage services. We were scheduled to be in Japan for one week with up to five meetings a day; about half of those were with new potential clients that I had sourced.

                <p>The trip was going well and we were acquiring new business when I received an inquiry from a large corporation in South Korea about our brokerage services. We were one of several companies being considered for a potential project. Realizing the advantage I had over the competition on the other side of the globe,I quickly arranged a meeting in South Korea at the end of my Japan trip. While in Korea, I was able to research additional prospective clients and arrange meetings with them as well.

                <p>Not only was this my first time to South Korea, it was my first time traveling on my own for the company. I was there for less than 36 hours, but the long flight home was bolstered by the fact that I had just landed two of the largest companies in the world as our clients.

                <p>Once the sales pitch was over, I was having lunch with our new client and asked why they had selected us so quickly after opening their RFP and hadn't yet met with any of our competitors y. The client replied, "Because you showed up."

                <p>I excel as a salesperson because I identify likely customers, I relentlessly prepare, I prioritize a deep understanding of the customer's needs and I show up for my customers every day.

                <p>Over the course of my career I have gained a reputation for someone who gets the job done. As a result, I regularly have clients approach me with problems that they have no idea how to solve. My focus is to gain a deep understanding of the challenge, work with the client on what an acceptable solution would look like, and then develop a plan for how to get there within the scoped parameters.

                <p>Recently, an individual that I had worked with for many years took a new position at a Fortune 100 company with virtually no support staff. They were hired to completely reinvent how the company approached intellectual property. On top of this, the company had a culture that made working with vendors extremely challenging.

                <p>Within a few months at the new job, they called me and asked for help. They needed a realistic assessment of their position in the market and to understand how they lined up against key competitors. They had a limited budget,an extremely tight timeline, and no way of getting the job done internally. We discussed how I would approach the challenge and what deliverables they could expect given their budget and timeline requirements. Within a day we were off and running.

                <p>We delivered the project before the deadline and under budget. The analysis and materials we generated served as the foundation for how their team approaches their mandate. They use our materials to update the C-Suite on their progress. We have worked with them on at least a dozen follow-up projects, even as their team has grown and we are treated as an integral part of their team.

                <p>There have been many cases like this over my career. I work very hard to listen deeply, craft innovative solutions, set reasonable expectations and then exceed them. This has enabled me to gain the trust of my clients and forge long-lasting partnerships.

                <p>One of the world's largest companies reached out with a problem. They had been tasked with generating consistent revenue through monetizing their intellectual property and were unsure how to approach it. Their asset portfolio was massive and they had no idea what was in there.

                <p>I generated a response to their RFP that involved creating a phased evaluation process, managing a team of 15+ subject matter experts (SMEs), developing a software application for easy access to the analysis we created, and creating a custom monetization framework to consistently meet their revenue goals. The budget was in the 7-figures. Our proposal was selected, leading to the largest and most complicated project I have ever managed.

                <p>For over a year I oversaw every facet of the project. By far, the most challenging aspect was managing the team of SMEs who were nearly all independent contractors. Each had unique schedules, expertise and limitations. I spent a significant portion of my time recruiting, training, scheduling, performing quality control reviews, and terminating underperforming SMEs.

                <p>Another significant challenge was the development of the software application. Due to the esoteric nature of the work we were performing, I was the person in the best position to design the software and lead the development team. It involved gaining a base-level understanding of several programming languages and UX/UI design.

                <p>We met with the client team monthly to present sample work product and show progress through targeted metrics. I managed the negotiations and scope adjustments as the client's objectives shifted several times.

                <p>Ultimately, we delivered on the engagement and provided the client with the foundation to support their monetization efforts. The deliverables we provided allowed the client to be recognized as a leader in IP monetization. We have used the same playbook I developed for this engagement multiple times, driving a substantial portion of our revenue over the years.

                <p>One of my roles has been to recruit, train, and manage a large pool of independent contractors. By nature of the relationship, these contractors can be trickier to manage than employees. As our company grew, I became concerned that our independent contractor team felt disengaged and disconnected from the work they were doing and the teams they were supporting. I decided to reframe the relationship to increase the satisfaction they received from their work with us and hopefully drive an increase in productivity.

                <p>I met with a few of our long-standing contractors to brainstorm. We developed a plan to help the contractors get to know each other better and understand how their work contributed to the larger project.

                <p>We implemented team-building events, like monthly Lunch & Learns, where our contractor team has the opportunity to meet together and ask questions of senior contractors. We adjusted our project kickoff meetings to incorporate contractors and solicit their feedback so they have visibility into how their work contributes to the larger effort.

                <p>The feedback from our contractors has been overwhelmingly positive. They noted that they have developed deeper relationships with other contractors and it feels more like a team environment where their opinion matters. In addition, because they know each other better, junior contractors feel less attacked when receiving feedback from other members of the team. 

                <p>As a leader, I am focused on understanding the unique skill set of each team member. I listen to the team to understand the challenges they are facing and do my best to eliminate or minimize the obstacles.

                <p>One of the main reasons I decided to pursue an MBA was to develop strong financial analysis capabilities to increase the level of sophistication of intellectual property asset valuations. Near the end of my degree, I received a call on a Friday night from a client that had an impossible request: We need you to value the entire AOL patent portfolio in 3 days. I remember the request so well because I was just a few days into paternity leave with our first child.

                <p>The AOL patent portfolio was being made available for purchase and many companies felt that it was a once-in-a-decade opportunity. Our client wanted to be part of the bidding and needed credible information ASAP. After telling the client that I couldn't come up with anything reasonable within that time frame, I began to craft a plan that would provide them with actionable valuation analysis in a timeline that would help them be competitive.

                <p>I engineered an income valuation methodology that provided a patent valuation range per patent based on factors like strength of the patent, size of the market, remaining life of the patent, etc. The strength of the model was not that it could provide a pinpoint accurate valuation for any individual patent, but that it could quickly provide a reasonable range for each patent . The data proved to be invaluable to our client in the sale of the portfolio. This model has held up well over the last 10 years and now forms the basis for how many companies approach patent valuation.

                <p>A key component that I believe is lost in most valuations, is how the information is going to be used. Understanding the objectives, I created a methodology that provides clients with actionable intelligence enabling better decisions.
